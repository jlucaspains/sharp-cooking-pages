# Documentation (work in progress)
Sharp Cooking is your personal cooking app. It is available for both Android and iOS devices (iPhone and iPod).

## Create or update a recipe
Creating or adjusting a recipe is as simple as it gets. Sharp Cooking's simplicity demand that we only have the absolutely required fields: Image, Title, Source, Ingredients, Instructions, and Notes. There are, however, a few conventions that will help your recipes look and work the best within Sharp Cooking:

1. Start each ingredient with a number followed by a unit of measure. e.g.: 5 grams salt
2. Separate ingredients by a new line
3. Keep ingredient description short. Use the notes fields for any lengthy description or explanation
4. Separate instructions by a new line. This is important so that Sharp Cooking will show each step in the timeline correctly
5. When denoting time in instructions use the following syntax where x is a number: x min; x minute; x minutes; x hour; x hours; x day; x days

## View a recipe
Sharp Cooking displays recipes using a timeline style which helps you know exactly when to start or continue cooking your recipe and breaks it down nicely in easy to consume bits.

### The multiplier feature
Use the multiplier feature when you want to cook more or less of a recipe. For instance, if you want half the servings, use the multiplier 0.5. If you want double the servings, use 2.

### Cooking start time feature
To start cooking later but know exactly when it will be done later, use the start time feature. Just pick when you want to start cooking and Sharp Cooking will calculate all the steps. You can further adjust the interval between steps without time in the Settings page.

## Keeping your recipe book safe
Sharp Cooking was designed for privacy, therefore, all of your data is only available in your device. In the interest of ensuring you remain in control of your data, Sharp Cooking does not automatically backs up your recipes. You can use the Backup feature in the Settings page, it will trigger a iOS or Android file save and allow you to select your favorite file store provider such as ICloud Drive, Dropbox, and Google Drive.
