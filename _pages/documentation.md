# Documentation
Sharp Cooking is your personal cooking app. It is available for both Android and iOS devices (iPhone and iPod).

## Create or update a recipe
Creating or adjusting a recipe is as simple as it gets. Sharp Cooking's simplicity demand that we only have the absolutely required fields: Image, Title, Source, Ingredients, Instructions, and Notes. There are, however, a few conventions that will help your recipes look and work the best within Sharp Cooking:

1. Start each ingredient with a number followed by a unit of measure. e.g.: 5 grams salt
2. Separate ingredients by a new line
3. Keep ingredient description short. Use the notes fields for any lengthy description or explanation
4. Separate instructions by a new line. This is important so that Sharp Cooking will show each step in the timeline correctly
5. When denoting time in instructions use the following syntax where x is a number: x min; x minute; x minutes; x hour; x hours; x day; x days

## View a recipe
Sharp Cooking displays recipes using a timeline style which helps you know exactly when to start or continue cooking your recipe and breaks it down nicely in easy to consume bits.

### The multiplier feature
Use the multiplier feature when you want to cook more or less of a recipe. For instance, if you want half the servings, use the multiplier 0.5. If you want double the servings, use 2.

### Cooking start time feature
To start cooking later but know exactly when it will be done later, use the start time feature. Just pick when you want to start cooking and Sharp Cooking will calculate all the steps. You can further adjust the interval between steps without time in the Settings page.

### Printing a recipe
Sometimes you just want to have that recipe in a pice of good old paper. You can now print your recipes directly from Sharp Cooking app.

### Focus mode (preview)
The focus mode allows you to focus on the recipe. It provides you bigger font for easier reading, narrates the recipe, and keeps track of time with built-in notifications to remind you the next step is due. 

First, enable focus mode in the Settings > Preview Features > Focus Mode

## Settings

### Creating a backup to keep your recipes safe
Sharp Cooking was designed for privacy, therefore, all of your data is only available in your device. In the interest of ensuring you remain in control of your data, Sharp Cooking does not automatically backs up your recipes. Instead, you need to use the Backup feature in the Settings page, it will trigger an iOS or Android file save and allow you to select your favorite file store provider such as ICloud Drive, Dropbox, and Google Drive.

### Restoring a backup
> Caution: if successful, the restore will replace all existing recipes with the ones in the backup file.

In case you made any mistake or something is wrong with your recipes, you can use the Restore feature in the Settings page to restore your last backup. A valid backup is a zip file created by the Sharp Cooking app. When you choose this option, it will ask you to choose which file provider and file to use. That's it. That's it. Your full recipe book will be restored. 

### Choosing between decimal or fractions
Some people like decimals like 1.5 and other people prefer fractions like 1 and 1/2. Regardless of preference, Sharp Cooking can show your recipe ingredient quantities just right. Just tap this feature in the Settings page to toggle between the two modes.

### Setting the default time between steps
Each step in the cooking process takes some time, from gathering ingredients, to prep and actual time in an oven, flame, fridge... You get the idea. The primary difference between Sharp Cooking and other apps is its timeline-based display. To that end, Sharp Cooking assign 5 minutes by default between steps where time information (e.g. "bake for 30 min") is not given. You can adjust this time in the Settings page. Note that any value provided is treated as minutes.

### Importing recipes from the internet
In version 1.1 we introduced an option where you can import recipes from supported websites. As of now, you can import from:
* [allrecipes.com](https://www.allrecipes.com/)
* [foodnetwork.com](https://www.foodnetwork.com/)
* [foolproofliving.com](https://foolproofliving.com/)
* [tudogostoso.com.br](https://www.tudogostoso.com.br/)
* [panelinha.com.br](https://www.panelinha.com.br/)
* [receitasnestle.com.br](https://www.receitasnestle.com.br/)
* [saboresajinomoto.com.br](https://www.saboresajinomoto.com.br/)
* [www.saltfatacidheat.com](https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/)
* [www.seriouseats.com](https://www.seriouseats.com/)
* [cafedelites.com](https://cafedelites.com/)
* [www.delicious.com.au](https://www.delicious.com.au/)
* [taste.com.au](https://taste.com.au/)
* [recipes.anovaculinary.com](https://recipes.anovaculinary.com/)
* [www.bowlofdelicious.com](https://www.bowlofdelicious.com)

Don't see your favorite website on this list? Email [Our Support Team](mailto:lpains.wp@gmail.com) to request support for it.

The feature is very simple, you provide the URL of a recipe from any of the support websites and sharp-cooking will do the rest. It is smart enough to break down the ingredients and steps for you so all you have to do is save.

## Sharing whole recipes

The basic share functionality only shares the recipe text. While that is nicely formatted, it does not allow for easily importing the recipe directly into Sharp Cooking. Now, you can finally share recipes including ingredients, Step-by-step instructions, and picture. Sharing is as easy as it gets, from the recipe display, select the ellipsis button and select share recipe as file option. Depending on the platform, you may have different options to share. Regardless of how you choose to share, as long as the recipient can receive a .zip file and they have Sharp Cooking installed, it will work. We do, however, have a few suggestions below.

### Sharing whole recipes from Android to Android
Use the Android Beam, Whatsapp, or email.

### Sharing whole recipes from iOS to iOS
Use the Air Drop, Whatsapp, or email.

### Sharing whole recipes from iOS to Android or vice-versa
Use Whatsapp or email.

### Receiving whole recipes
Receiving is even easier than sharing. Whichever file sharing platform you choose, you have only to open the .zip file received and choose Sharp Cooking as the app to open it.

### Duplicating recipes (tip)
If you ever wanted to duplicate a recipe and make modifications to the copy, you can now do that by leveraging the Share Recipe feature. Share the recipe and choose Sharp Cooking and the recipe will be automatically duplicated. Simple like that.

### Sharing your whole recipe book (tip)
Backing up your recipes or sharing them use the same approach in Sharp Cooking. This gives you the ability to take a backup in Settings page and send the generated file to a friend or family (because nobody would share cooking secrets with anyone else, right?).

## Dark Mode
Go easy on your eyes with Dark Mode. Enable it in your device's settings and the app will respect it right away. For best results, please restart the app after changing the device's theme.

In Android, go to Settings > Display > Dark Theme.

In iOS, go to Settings > Display & Brightness > Appearance > Dark

## Sorting recipes
In the recipe list page you have the option to sort them by Title, Recently created or updated, and Rating. This allows you to see your recipes in whichever order you prefer.

## Keeping screen on
There is nothing more annoying than the phone screen shutting down while you are cooking and have something on your hands. You can now disable the screen lock right from the recipe display.
